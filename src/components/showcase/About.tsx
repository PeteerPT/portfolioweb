                        I'm a Full Stack Developer with a deep enthusiasm for technology and problem-solving. 
                        Until March 2025, I served as 2nd Commander of PELAP in the Portuguese Army. During this time, 
                        I faced diverse operational and logistical challenges that sparked my interest in software development

                    <p>
                        I've always been curious about how things work especially when it comes to technology and systems. 
                        That curiosity, combined with the leadership experience I gained in the military, guided me toward a new path in software development. 
                        I'm currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at Universidade Nove de Julho (UNINOVE), 
                        laying a strong foundation in modern development methodologies.

                        My journey into tech was shaped by hands-on experience managing internal systems 
                        and contributing to organizational precision during my time in the military. 
                        Those responsibilities sparked a lasting interest in software engineering 
                        motivating me to explore programming languages, clean code practices, and project development.

                                I strive to write clean, well-structured code that's built for performance and long-term maintenance.
